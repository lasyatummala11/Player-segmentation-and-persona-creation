# Player-segmentation-and-persona-creation

# Overview

This project focuses on analyzing player behavior and preferences in the gaming industry to develop targeted marketing strategies. Using advanced clustering techniques, players were segmented into distinct personas based on features such as discount sensitivity, review sentiment, and engagement patterns.

# Objectives

Segment players into meaningful groups to understand their behavior.

Define personas to enhance personalized marketing campaigns.

Provide actionable insights for improving player engagement and revenue generation.

# Key Features

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values and outliers.

Normalizing numerical features for clustering.

Clustering:

K-Means clustering to identify player segments.

PCA for dimensionality reduction and cluster visualization.

Persona Creation:

Discount Seekers: Motivated by discounts.

Positive Review Enthusiasts: Focused on highly rated games.

Mixed Sentiment Gamers: Curious about polarizing or niche games.

Neutral Buyers: General audience with balanced preferences.

# Tools and Technologies

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries and Frameworks: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
